    <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Drain and set aside.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparation of Meat or Vegetables:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>If using meat, marinate it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and spices like turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>If using vegetables, you can sauté them with spices separately or use them directly in the layers.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sautéing Aromatics:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot or pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Then add chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and pulpy.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Layering:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker, start layering the ingredients.</li>
                <li> Begin with a layer of cooked meat or vegetables at the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of partially cooked rice on top of the meat/vegetables. </li>
                <li>Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped herbs, and a few saffron-infused milk strands. </li>
                <li>Repeat the layers until all the meat/vegetables and rice are used up. The top layer should be rice.</li>    
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cooking:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid to trap the steam.</li>
                <li>Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once done, remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes before opening the lid.</li>
            </ol>
